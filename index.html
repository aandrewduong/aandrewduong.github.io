      <h2>BIO</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles, pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science & Linguistics. Originally from San Jose, CA, I began my academic journey at De Anza College, where I built a strong foundation in computer science before transferring to UCLA. My interests lie at the intersection of technology and language, with a focus on machine learning, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and AI-driven language models. I am also interested in sports analytics, blockchain technology, and technical writing. My experience includes frontend and backend development, automation tools, and data structures, allowing me to build and optimize scalable applications. I am passionate about solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and exploring how AI can enhance human communication. Expected to graduate in Spring 2026, I am excited to continue growing as a developer, researcher, and problem-solver while working on impactful projects that push the boundaries of technology.

            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayleigh-liu/" target="_blank">Hayleigh Liu</a>, utilizing Git for version control to streamline our workflow and ensure efficient project management. Together, we designed an intuitive user interface and implemented backend services to support real-time interactions. Additionally, I leveraged web scraping techniques to dynamically extract and integrate real-time data from UCLA websites, ensuring students have access to up-to-date and relevant information.

            Healthy on The Hill allows students to connect with gym buddies based on fitness goals and levels, create personalized fitness plans with recommended gym equipment, view live food options on the Hill with meal ratings, and check live activity levels of dining halls and gyms. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in full-stack development, team collaboration, and optimizing web applications for a smooth and responsive user experience.
