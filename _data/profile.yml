about_paragraphs:
  - I am a 4th-year undergraduate at **UCLA** majoring in **Computer Science and Linguistics**. I'm fascinated by the intersection of human language and code, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics.
  - Currently, I'm at **Illumio**, where I build technical documentation infrastructure. My work focuses on internal tools and a SaaS REST API documentation platform to automate and optimize the deployment and maintenance of technical documentation.
  - I'm passionate about creating automation systems to eliminate repetitive workflows. Whether it's streamlining enrollment processes or building low-latency tracking networks, I enjoy solving complex problems with elegant code. I'm also deeply interested in blockchain technology and its potential to decentralize the web.
